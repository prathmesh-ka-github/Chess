        <p3> &nbsp;&nbsp;
            This Four-player chess is a variation of original classical chess that involves four players, each
            controlling their own set of pieces. In this game, players must not only focus on their opponents directly
            in front of them, but also keep an eye on the actions of their two other opponents, adding a complex layer of strategy 
            and tactics to the game.
            With four players, the game is more dynamic and fast-paced, requiring players to constantly adapt to
            changing situations and think several moves ahead. 

            The rules and regulations are exactly the same as the traditional 2-player chess for example, castling, pawn
            promotion at 8th rank, and piece moves, checkmate and stalemate positions, the pieces all being the
            same (pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, kings), etc. 

            This game will have a change of chess board layout to adjust to 4 player variation. The main middle 64
            squares(8 rows and 8 files) will be the same but each side will have it's own additional 3 rows on their
            side with 2 rows containing their pieces and 1 row blank.<br><br>

            <p5> al-Biruni, was a Khwarazmian Iranian scholar In his “Encyclopedia of Indian culture” contains the
                description about “Chaturanga” a four handed board game which was played using a four-faced dice, which
                was unknown to arabs in late 800th century AD. The four-faced die was rolled to determine which piece
                was to play.That leads us to say that not only 4-player chess but also chess itself originated from
                India.</p5>

            The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with
            standardisation and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's
            most popular games, played by millions of people

            The game enjoyed a considerable following until the end of the 19th century (the White collection club has a
            score book of it) after which support slowly declined.
            According to David B. Pritchard, Four-player chess "is generally understood to be a game played with two
            sets on a standard board with four extensions, one on each side, usually of 8x3 squares (arguably the best
            arrangement) but sometimes 8x2 or 8x4, on which the pieces are set up in the normal array positions.

                    Four-Handed Chess is loosely any variant for four players. More specifically, it is generally
                    understood to be
                    a partnership game played with two sets on a standard board with four extensions, one on each side,
                    usually of 8x3
                    squares (arguably the best arrangement) but sometimes 8x2 or 8x4, on which the pieces are set up in
                    the normal array
                    positions. The four-handed game dates from the 18th century and enjoyed considerable popularity,
                    particularly in Germany
                    but also in England - The Philidorian reported (1838) ‘The game of chess for four is advancing daily
                    in fashion and favor
                    with the British Public’. The year before it had been described as coming from Germany, ‘the only
                    country where it is
                    practised’.

        <p7>During the half-century 1825-1875, numerous booklets appeared, mostly in the U.K. but also in Europe and
            America, giving basic rules for four-player chess. Almost all of these, some little more than pamphlets,
            carried only the name of the publisher. The game was dismissed as ‘a kind of whist’ (Le Palamède). Another
            theory has the game originating in Russia.</p7>
